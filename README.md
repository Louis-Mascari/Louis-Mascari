### 👋 Hello, I'm Louis!

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer at Songtrust, working with Python/Django, React/TypeScript, GraphQL/REST and AWS to build and maintain features for a music royalty administration platform.

While I'm very happy in my current role, I'm always open to hearing about new opportunities where I can leverage my full-stack development expertise.

Previously, I developed [MIMIC](https://mimic-replay.com), an open-source session replay framework simplifying recording and replaying user sessions.
