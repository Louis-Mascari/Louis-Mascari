### üëã Hello, I'm Louis!

I'm a full-stack software engineer experienced in JavaScript/Node.js, TypeScript, React, Ruby, Python, Golang, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, AWS, and other tools.

I'm currently seeking my next role and am excited to continue contributing to innovative projects and tackling new challenges in the tech industry.

Most recently, I built [MIMIC](https://mimic-replay.com), an open-source session replay framework simplifying recording & replaying user sessions to enhance web application debugging. You can read our in-depth technical case study [here](https://mimic-replay.com/#case-study)!
