# Hi, I'm Louis! 👋

I'm a **Full Stack Software Engineer** at **Songtrust**, where I build modern web applications and royalty platforms using **TypeScript, React, GraphQL, Python, Django, and AWS**.

### 🧩 The "Diagnostic" Mindset
Uniquely, I transitioned to engineering after a career as a **Doctor of Physical Therapy**.
* **Then:** Diagnosing patients to treat the root cause of their pain.
* **Now:** Diagnosing complex codebases to improve user experiences.
* **The Result:** I build products that are healthy, maintainable, and empathetic to the user.

### 🔭 Open Source
I co-created **[MIMIC](https://mimic-replay.com)**, an open-source session replay framework.
* **The Goal:** To give developers "visual empathy" by letting them see exactly what their users experience, rather than just reading logs.
* **The Architecture:** We engineered a **4-stage telemetry pipeline** (Instrumentation, Emitting, Shipping, Presentation) to handle high-volume event streams.
* **The Challenge:** To balance write-latency with storage costs, we implemented a **hybrid storage strategy**—buffering active session data in-memory for speed before compressing and shipping it to object storage for long-term persistence.

### 🤝 Let's Connect
I'm always down to nerd out about:
* Frontend Architecture & UX
* Video Games (Ask me about the OSRS economy 🦀)
* Lifting / Fitness
* Music Tech
* The transition from Healthcare to Tech
